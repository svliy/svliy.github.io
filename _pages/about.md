<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Peking University, expected to graduate in 2025. My research focuses on spike-based artificial intelligence and spiking neural networks. My mission is to empower spike-based AI and promote the field of artificial intelligence towards a sustainable development path. If you're interested in my work or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at **djh01998@stu.pku.edu.cn**.

My research interest includes machine learning with spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware. I have published more than 10 papers at the top international AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, IJCAI, etc.) with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4rDfCSsAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>580+</span></strong></a>.
